Version 0.1.0
1. Integrated MQTT, DynamoDB, Flutter_Reactive_BLE into application.
2. Application can now continuously scan for surrounding BLE devices and perform localisation locally.
3. Application is able to log sensors data onto a .csv over MQTT in real time.
4. Application can connect to ESP32 and send characteristic values over BLE.
5. Phased out Flutter_Blue package.

Version 0.2.0
1. Phased out [double] and used [num] instead.
2. Localisation now stores previous values and display them in the event of ZeroDivisionError.
3. _bleDevices now clears itself after each localisation --> this is to ensure that the beacons received are the closest beacons.
4. Navigatino based on compass heading is integrated but algorithm is still buggy.
